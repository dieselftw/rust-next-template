This is my starter template for making new apps. It's got a Next.js web server and a Rust backend, all wrapped up in Docker. I use this as my starting point for most projects because it works well for me.

I'll probably change things as I learn about new tech stuff. If you want to use this template or help make it better, go ahead. Just remember, it might look different in the future as I try out new things.
